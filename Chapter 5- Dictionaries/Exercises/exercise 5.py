# Exercise 5: Pets (Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and as you do, print everything you know about each pet)

# Creating an empty list named "pets" that would store multiple dictionaries, each representing a pet.
pets = []

pet = { # Store information to each pet in the list.
    'Kind of Animal (Species)': 'Dog',
    'Breed': 'Maltipoo',
    'Name': 'Coffee',
    'Age': '4 Months Old',
    'Gender': 'Male',
    'Owner': 'Isaac',
}
pets.append(pet) # The pets.append(pet) line is used to add each pet dictionary to the list named "pets", which can be accessed and printed later using a for loop.

pet = { # Store information to each pet in the list.

    'Breed': 'Minuet',
