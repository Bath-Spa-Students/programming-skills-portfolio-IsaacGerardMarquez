# Exercise 5: Favorite Fruit (Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.)
# •Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
# •Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement,such as You really like bananas!

# List of my three (3) favorite fruits
favorite_fruits = ['mangoes', 'avocadoes', 'bananas']

# Write five (5) if statements that each check whether the fruit is in my list. If the fruit is in my list (favorite_fruits), the if block would print a statement, such as You really like (the fruit that is in my list)!
if 'mangoes' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like mangoes!")
if 'apples' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like apples!")
if 'orange' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like orange!")
if 'watermelon' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like watermelon!")
if 'avocadoes' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like avocadoes!")
