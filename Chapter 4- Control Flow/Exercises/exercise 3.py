# • If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
# • If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
# • If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
# • Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the appropriate color alien.
