#Exercise 2: Alien Colors #2 (Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and write an if-else chain.)
#•If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
#•If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
#•Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

# Program that runs the if block
alien_color = "green"
if alien_color == "green":
    print("Congratulations on shooting the alien! You just earned 5 points!")
else:
    print("Congratulations! You just earned 10 points!")

# Program that runs the else block
alien_color = "orange"
if alien_color == "green":
    print("Congratulations on shooting the alien! You just earned 5 points!")
else:
    print("Congratulations! You just earned 10 points!")
