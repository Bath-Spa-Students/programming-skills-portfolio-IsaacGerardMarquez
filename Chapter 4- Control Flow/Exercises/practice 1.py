# Practice 1: Write a python program with if statement that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the variable z if the variable & is greater than 100.

# Create a variable named "x" that has a value of 368
x = 368

# Create an if statement that would determine if the variable named "x" is greater than 100.
# If it meets the condition (True), the code block inside the if statement is executed.
if x > 100:
    y = 20
    z = 40

# Create a print() function that uses f-string formatting to output the values of x, y, and z.
print (f"y = {y}")
print (f"z = {z}")
