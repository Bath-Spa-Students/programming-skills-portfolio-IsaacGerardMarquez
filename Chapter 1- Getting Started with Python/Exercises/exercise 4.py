#Exercise 4: Strings Concatenation (Write three strings in different variables and print the output as one string.)

# Writing three strings in different variables. Each variable is assigned with a specific string value.
String1 = "Python"
String2 = "is"
String3 = "captivating."

# Concatenating the three strings in different variables together with the use of the "+" operator.
New_string= String1 + " " + String2 + " " + String3

# Using the print() function to print or display the value that is stored in the variable named "New_string".
print(New_string)
