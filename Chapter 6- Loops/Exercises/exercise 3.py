# Exercise 3: Infinity (Write a loop that never ends, and run it. (To end the loop, press ctrl-C or close the window displaying the output.))

# The while loop is set to execute indefinitely because the condition "True" is always true.
# This creates an infinite loop that will  execute continuously until the loop is interrupted or terminated.
while (True):

# The print() function is used to print or display the string "My name is Isaac." on the console.
    print ("My name is Isaac.")
