# Practice 2: Write a Python program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

print("The Numbers from 1 to 10 are: ")
# Creating a program that would take a range from 1 to 11.
for n in range(1, 11):
   
# Printing or displaying all numbers in an interval 1 to 11 using the For Loop.
   print(n, end=' ')
