# Practice 3: Assume names references a list. Write a for loop that displays each element of the list.

# Creating a list named Famous_Mathematicians that stores the following strings: 'Einstein', Newton' , 'Copernicus', and 'Kepler'
Famous_Mathematicians = ['Einstein', 'Newton' , 'Copernicus', 'Kepler']

# Use for loop to iterate over each element in the list named "Famous_Mathematician". 
for Famous_Mathematician in Famous_Mathematicians:

# Use print() function to print or display the value of "Famous_Mathematician".
    print (Famous_Mathematician)
