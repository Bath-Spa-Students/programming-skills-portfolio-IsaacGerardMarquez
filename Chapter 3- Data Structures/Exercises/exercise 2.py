# Exercise 2: Greetings (Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.)

# Creating a list called Names that would store the names of a few of my friends.
Names = ['Yyan', 'John', 'Radjn']

## Printing each person with the same message but each personalized with the person’s name.
Message = f"Long time no see, {Names[0].title()}!"
print (Message)

Message = f"Long time no see, {Names[1].title()}!"
print (Message)

Message = f"Long time no see, {Names[2].title()}!"
print (Message)
